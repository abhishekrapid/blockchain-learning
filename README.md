  A TodoList program implemented in Solidity is a smart contract that allows users to create, view, and complete tasks on the Ethereum blockchain. Here is a basic outline of the steps you can follow to implement a TodoList program in Solidity:

> Define the contract structure: Start by defining the basic structure of your contract, including the variables and functions that it will need to store and manipulate the tasks. You will need to define a Task struct to represent each task, and a mapping to store the tasks.

 > Implement the task management functions: You will need to implement functions to create, view, and complete tasks. This might include functions like createTask, getTask, and completeTask, which allow users to add tasks to the TodoList, view the details of a task, and mark a task as complete.

 > Test the contract: Before deploying your contract to the Ethereum blockchain, it is important to thoroughly test it to ensure that it is working correctly. You can use a tool like Truffle or Remix to test your contract using mock data and sample transactions.

 > Deploy the contract: Once you are satisfied that your contract is working correctly, you can deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Truffle or Remix. You will need to have an Ethereum wallet and some Ether (the native cryptocurrency of the
